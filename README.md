# Master-of-the-Future
This is the applications that I worked on for studying React Native. I was young in that time and a fan of Latin name so thats why you see my project folder are name in Latin.

The applications I created is - as the name suggests - use to connect the users with the Palm Reading Master or Physiognomy Master. The idea is that the user will use the "deusimperator" app as the client, they can send the picture of their hand or their face to the central app - the "masterapp" one so the Masters can see the picture and the message and then interact with the users. To sum up, this is an messenger app built exclusively for the pseudoscience purpose.


I discontinued the development of the application because the Google Firebase is not allow me to take the URL of the picture without tokens, and the Facebook's integration of Firebase is poorly done, that I cannot fetch the image from the Firebase to the application.

If you are still interested in continue the development, you should have the requirement:
- Android Studio (For the Android Emulator)
- Node.js (For running the server locally)
- npm

So after you cloned the project, run the command:
- npm install .
